# KOTOVERSE: A Collaborative NFT Marketplace for Fiction Books

## Short Description
"KOTOVERSE" is a collaborative NFT marketplace for fiction books.
KOTOBA means words in Japanese. Shall we begin a text-based metaverse with your KOTOBA?

## Long Description
This time, we have developed an NFT novel marketplace that makes it easier for novelists to earn revenue easily compared to paper books or Kindle publishing. Using the Blockchain Novel website, users are free to submit their novels, set the price as NFT, and sell them. Novels are separated by category, making it easy for users to find novels that interest them.

## How It's Made
Our product uses Polygon to write text data on chain. Using Polygon chain has allowed us to achieve a better user experience, with lower gas costs and faster transactions. As the main technology stack, Solidity was used to write the smart contracts, and the front end was implemented in React.

## Technology Stacks
- Front-End: React, Vite
- Smart Contract: Solidity (Polygon), Hardhat
- Data Storage: IPFS
- Other Tools/APIs: Worldcoin, Unlock Protocol, Push Protocol

- We're aiming a prize for best UX / best metaverse or gaming project.
- Our collaborative platform where fans, authors, and illustrators frequently purchase NFTs from each other requires fast, stress-free transactions and low gas fees. Polygon is well positioned to meet these requirements while improving our brand as a chain with a low environmental impact.

## What's Next
We would like to create community functions for writers and illustrators to interact with other creators and fans.
- Chat feature with XMTP (In Preparation)
- Visualization of the social graph between creators and fans
